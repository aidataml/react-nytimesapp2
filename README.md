# API Used:
NY Times News API: https://developer.nytimes.com/apis

# The title of your site and a link to the URL where it is deployed.
NY Times News App: https://react-nytimesapp2.onrender.com/

# Describe what your website does.
The app is a compilation of news articles from the NY Times at https://www.nytimes.com.

# List the features you implemented and explain why you chose those features to implement.
The app allows users to store favorite articles from the NY Times news site so they can maintain a log of articles to revisit at their leisure.
 
# Where your tests are and how to run them.
Tests are at App.test.js and you can run them using jest.

# Walk someone through the standard user flow for the website.
The user ccan browse articles or signup/login to store favorite articles. 

# Keep the API in there, and if you have anything to say about the API then add some notes. If you have created your own API, please document the process.
I chose world news as my topic of choice, so the app retrieves articles within that genre.

# Identify the technology stack used to create your website.
The app was created using React and Firebase.

# Include anything else that you feel is important to share.
You can get started with the following instructions for creating a React app. 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
